        <p id="tribute-info"> Randy Rhoads born Randall William Rhoads lived from 
            December 6 1956 - March 19 1982. Randy was most famously known for being the first guitarist
            for Ozzy Obsburne after Ozzy was fired from Black Sabbath.
            Randy was a huge influence on the Metal, Hard Rock, 
            and Neo-Nlassical Metal. Randy Rhoads was so good that he was a rival to guitar god Eddie Van Halen. But Randy was most famous for his polka dot black and white guitar 
            (as seen in the photo), and being Ozzy Osburne's first guitarist when 
            Ozzy was fired from Black Sabbath. Before Randy would end up joining Ozzy's band, he played with Los Angeles band Quiet Riot.
